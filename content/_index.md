        I use data and quantitative methods to study economic and financial questions, with a focus on risk, uncertainty, and decision-making. My work draws on statistics, machine learning, and applied data analysis to turn complex datasets into practical insights.

        I am always open to collaboration and conversation – feel free to reach out.
